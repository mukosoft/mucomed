## What is MucoMed? <a name="what-is-mucomed"></a>

MucoMed is intended to give people suffering from [cystic fibrosis](https://mukosoft.de/was-ist-mukoviszidose/) support in everyday life. 
The following features have been developed for this purpose:

- Medication schedule
- Recording of vital data
- saving of doctor's reports
- a cookbook with recipes
- An information board
- Data analysis (BMI curve, FEV-1 curve).

## Data use & privacy <a name="data-use-and-privacy"></a>

### What data is collected by the app? <a name="what-data-collected"></a>

Data collected by the app, include.

- One's own medication schedule,
- one's own vital signs,
- one's own documents and doctor's reports,
- any other user input and information which has not been mentioned.

All this data is stored exclusively on the smartphone. An Internet connection is therefore not 
basic requirement for the core use of the app.

### What does the app use internet for? <a name="wofuer-internet"></a>

The app requires an internet connection for the "Cookbook" and "Information" functions. If recipes from the cookbook are 
are saved as favorites, they can also be accessed offline. 

### What are the disadvantages? <a name="what-disadvantages"></a>.

Since the data is only stored on the smartphone, it must be exported when the smartphone is changed and then 
be imported again. **Deleted data is gone and cannot be recovered!**

## Contribution & Acknowledgement <a name="contribution-acknowledgement"></a>

The development of the app would not work without the numerous support. Both from my friends and circle of friends and acquaintances, as well as directly from the community came incredibly much support. Therefore I thank all those,
who helped me with the development, the gathering of information, searching and entering recipes and the
and making the app known.
